Expanding **dungeon matchmaking** in WoW Classic can enhance **group formation, accessibility, and engagement**. Hereâ€™s how we can integrate it into the **Lionheart Love Patch**:  

### **ðŸ’– Dungeon Matchmaking System for Love-Themed Adventures**  
âœ… **Lovebound Dungeon Finder** â€“ Players can queue for **love-themed dungeons**, automatically pairing with compatible adventurers.  
âœ… **Coupleâ€™s Trials Dungeon** â€“ A **two-player dungeon** where matched players must **solve puzzles and defeat enemies together**.  
âœ… **Faction-Crossed Dungeon Runs** â€“ Allow **Horde & Alliance matchmaking**, creating **forbidden love questlines**.  
âœ… **Buff Synergy Mechanics** â€“ Matched players receive **Eternal Bonds buffs**, increasing **damage, healing, and defense** when fighting together.  

### **ðŸ›  Technical Implementation**  
âœ… **Lua-Based Dungeon Queue System** â€“ Players interact with **Madame Florence** to enter matchmaking.  
âœ… **Database Integration** â€“ Store matchmaking preferences and **track dungeon completion rewards**.  
âœ… **UI Enhancements** â€“ Create a **matchmaking interface** for dungeon queue selection.  
âœ… **Event Logging & Debugging** â€“ Track matchmaking success rates and **adjust balancing accordingly**.
